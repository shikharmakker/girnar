<p style="font-family: helvetica; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 1.2em; text-align: justify;">Founded in 2013, the Girnar House, newest and the biggest hostel in the institute, is a residential hostel made up of undergraduate students, postgraduate students and Phds at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, located in one of the most posh areas of New Delhi, Hauz Khas. Girnar stands out among all the hostels, not only because of the numerous trophies and positions we have achieved within three years, but also because it is the nearest hostel from the Lecture Hall Complex (LHC).<br><br><br>

Being a part of Girnar, you will find yourself in one of the most interactive place of IITD, whether it is the brotherhood with your wing mates or the seniors who are there to guide you every time. The night-outs together, inter wing culture and the enthusiasm during the events have their own enigma. No one is more proud than a Girnar resident. Every pass-out takes with him the memories of this glory and legacy. Every fresher will feel the aura!</p><br><br><br>
